openfl-pixi.js
==============

 Alternative HTML5 backend for OpenFL that uses [dev branch of pixi.js library](<https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/tree/dev>) for rendering to WebGL / 2D canvas.

Currently only the following classes are partly done:
- flash.display.DisplayObject
- flash.display.DisplayObjectContainer
- flash.display.Sprite
- flash.display.Stage
- flash.display.Graphics
- flash.Lib (still needs lots of work)

All other classes are direct copies from [openfl-html5 backend](<https://github.com/openfl/openfl-html5v>) and most still need to be modified.
